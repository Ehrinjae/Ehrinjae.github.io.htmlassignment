<p>About myself i lived in phillippine 16 years i got alot memories and good and bad time back in my home country i really miss my friends there and my girlfriend there tho. i wish i can go back home but i just have to finish my school and focus to my goal. I miss phillippines because i dont have to worry about snow lol or cold because back there we just wear shorts and pants it's really hot there and i don't recoomend to wear any hoodie but still there's alot mountains nad island that you can explore there we got boracay island's and alot mountain and province. And alot food that you can try too. we got sinigang,adobo,letchon.letche plan, halo halo we got alot really good food but i don't recommend eating balot i personally never tried It

You can search it but i know alot people gonna say it's not appetizing to eat it and you can some beer too and alot alcohol there too i usesd to drink there after shcool and im out of school for 3 days because  i still have hang over. We drink alot back there but that's how we have fun tho. we got alot pool there too sins it's always hot there too. we only hace 2 seasons raining and summer that's it only thing that cold if you go to baguio city that city is really cold and it sucks because when i came there  i don't have any winter jacket or anything only hoodie and when i came home i got sick because my body can't take the temperature out there. It's really good and fun in phillippines you can do alot stuff there and just make more memories.</p>

<h3>I lived with my grandparents for 16 years the reason why i live to my grandparents because my mom is OFW she used to work at saudi arabia and dubai we only see each other for likw months in 1 year because she have to go back in saudi or dubai she work in hospital, she's register nurse and she work at operating room sometimes she work in ER-emergecny room. i dont know much about my father because he left us when i was 6 years old tho.  we're not in good terms lately we got argue about something too so i don't know how i can described my father. they're devourse so that's why i don't see my father he's in phillipines right now .but out that in the side. I love my life  right now because i still have my stepdad to guide me or help me out tho and i love playing basketball i used to play alot and train alot to improve mt skills in basketball but because of alot injuries and i have to manage my time so i have to stop either school,basketball or work i just rether choose to drop basketball to be honest i love playing but i have to priotieze now because i don't gain anything playing basketball if i work i got money.
If i go to school i got better job,better career and alot money. if i choose playing basketball i dont gain money or better job so i just stick to my decision that i'll rather focus on studying and work so that i can pay my tuition and my bills i have to be practicall in mty life because sooner or later we never if im gonna have family i wanna get them better life and especially for my girlfriend she understand eveything about me and she told me to stud. You have to go back to school. i've been with her sins i was grade.8 we've together for 7 years and almost 8 years this year.I always play video games i do stream sometimes i just don't much time to live but i used to stream in facebook page. it's all about horror games people this days they just wanna see people how they got scared or reaction to horror games. i love streaming and playing games sametime but just like i said i don't much have time to play my pc i build gaming pc too it's just take alot time at first but i really like tho.I used to be one of the best point guard in our subdivisions back in phillipines they always want me to lay for team for money game.
like we play and bet money on the line so that they can get serious and to have extra money and at my school in phillipines they always see me and then thay ask me to play after schoool we go around courts other subdivsions. used to do hang time in air lol that's what they always telling me.I love playing tho i always remember everytime i played but because of alot injuries i got sprain so many times on my laft and right ankle and i have 4 stitches on my right knee then i have brokenbone or something in my right hand thumb.That's one of the reason why i stoped because people think im not good enough anymore because i can't shoot properly anymore and i can't get rebound's i used to be so yeah they think im not really good anymore and i was like well it's not my primtime anymore sins i got injuries and i got busy at my job and school now.it's always a big day and always have to work everyday.so far i love living here in canada the only thing that i dont really like is snow i just don't want snow at all and cold too. Because i can't walk outside and i can't play basketball outside. i used to do that just walk outside and 
play basketball and hangout with my friends.

<p>I came here in canada sept.20 2018 it's really hard to move out and move on for the next chapter of my life to be honest when i came here in canada i was really sacared because i don't know about anything i just only know that i got lo oppotunity here.When i came here it's hard to sleep and it's hard for me to communicate to people but sins i work in retirement home i have to learn. I learn alot to residence because they always tried to talk to me and come to think of it i can learn from them. They always talk to me about their life about their job it almost evrything i used that to take advantage to learn english to tak to them straight and understand english.And i guess it work well for me because i know now how to communicate with them and sametime learn how to used exact words.To be honest i never expect that i can do it. sins then they always wnat me to serve them they always ask me how's my school or how's my day. i work there for 4 years now im always food server there if there's no dishwasher i do dishes. i work 80 hours before school start. I start 6:00am-8:00pm i served breakfast and clean prep for lunch
Because i have to served lunch and after lunch i have to clean and prep for dinner then break after that i have to switch yo dishes after prep tray order and take them to their rooms and i have to comedown and do dishes. After that coming home like 8:30 and then sleep then work again tommorrow. LIfe is hard i have to save money for school and pay bills and eventually planning to get car too this year so it's really hard but i know i can manage it and i know im not alone tho my family,friends and my girlfriend always there to guide me. Right now im hoping to ahieve my goals like got a house for me and to my girlfriend, got new car so that we don't have to wait for so long for bus and ofcouse graduate college so that i can get better job and get fulltime and save money for other goals.
its not gonna be easy i know that i have to struggle in order to achieve my goal. I'll never give up on that that's one of my goal and i really wanna grab my oppturnity to achieve those goals.</p>
